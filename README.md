# UofT-CSC309 Programming on the Web Project: Restaurant Reviewing Web Application

Our project is a restaurant reviewing website that serves both customers and owners of restaurants.  

On one hand, it allows individuals to view and post reviews of various restaurants. The website provides useful suggestions and saves a lot of time for our users because when they have no idea where to eat, they can use our website as a reference. For example, they can either select a food category and sort all the relevant restaurants by ratings, then pick the desired one or just search the name of one particular restaurant. It also encourages the customers to write reviews about their experiences to recommend the restaurant to others or remind the owners of the restaurants to enhance their services.  

On the other hand, it provides the owners of the restaurants a platform to promote their food and attract more customers. The owners can sign up on our website as an owner and update the information of the restaurant to let the individuals write the reviews. It also benefits the owners because they can get feedback from customers and improve their services or foods.


## What are all the different things a user will do when they use your web app?
1. Users can search restaurants. When they are looking for some reviews, menu, pictures of the food, restaurant conditions, telephone number, price level and any other information of some particular restaurants, they can search the restaurants using our website, and our website can provide all the information that the users need.
2. Users can also choose some particular categories of restaurants like sushi, Korean BBQ, hot pot, fast food, etc.
3. In the home page, users can choose a city in GTA and see the top 10 restaurants in that city.
4. Users can see a list of restaurants in a city or region. For example, if a user wants to search for restaurants in Markham, he can enter the location – Markham, and the website would
 4
automatically generate a list of restaurants in Markham by a certain order that the user chooses.
5. Users can choose how to rank the list of restaurants. Choices are by price, by reviews and by popularities.
6. Users can review restaurants. When users finish their meal in a restaurant, they can write a simple review in our website along with an overall star rating for that restaurant.
7. Restaurants’ owners can register for their restaurants in our website. They can post their introductions, food menus and prices under their restaurant pages. The owner can add elements, edit, and manage his restaurant page.
8. Individuals can register their profiles in our website by their email address. They can bookmark their favourite restaurants under “My Favourite” section in My account page, so they do not have to remember and search hard for the restaurants they like again when they want to retrieve the information. They can also change password, username, read their review history in My Account setting page. We will provide a set of given profile pictures for them to choose.
9. Without registration, users can still use our website reading reviews and searching for restaurants. But they cannot write reviews and bookmark any restaurants they are interested.
